#Tuples
#Tuples
# are the same as lists
# only the brackets change
# an example below 

#Craeting a tuple
#A tuple with different data types

a = ('Godfrey', 1, "Gudah")

print(a)

b = (3, "Joel", 10.0, 12.776767654, "Skeeper")

#Adding tuples together

print(a + b)


#Slicing a tuple

print (a[2])

#Length of a tuple
print("\nThe Length of tuple a is: ")
print(len(a))
print("\nThe length of tuple b is: ")
print(len(b))

#converting a variable to a tuple

c = "Godfrey"

d = 12

f = 10.0

print(tuple(c))
